      "question": "What is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)?",
      "answer": "HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) is the study of how people interact with computers and digital systems. It combines psychology to understand user behavior and cognition, design to create intuitive and accessible interfaces, and technology to develop interactive systems. HCI helps ensure that digital tools are not only functional but also user-friendly and engaging.",
