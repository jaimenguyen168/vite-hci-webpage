In the lab, I worked with a talented team on a novel chatbot UI project (<strong>Feedstack</strong>), which was both fun, challenging, and rewarding! That experience in conversational UI design helped me land my first full-time role as an Analyst & UX Designer at URBN (Urban Outfitters, Inc) for their retail chatbots. I'm so grateful that but most importantly the memories and people I've met at Temple HCI!",
